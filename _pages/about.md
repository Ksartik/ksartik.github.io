I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at Georgia Institute of Technology, being advised by [Prof. Srijan Kumar](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~skumar498/) and mentored by [Dr. Rakshit Trivedi](https://www.rtrivedi.me/). Through my research, my goal is to study and build machine learning (🤖) models, which are robust to perturbations (🦺) and can be easily controlled (🎛️) by the users, specifically, in relational (eg., graph), ordered (eg., language, decision process), and dynamic (eg., dynamic graph, multi-agent) environments. These environments are unique in how they can model numerous real-world applications while providing a mathematical formalism. My motivation arises from the fact that these models are inherently probabilistic and non-deterministic by nature and may behave differently from the users’ expectations, hindering their widespread adoption. Thus, it is important that we ensure that the model's behavior remains stable under reasonable perturbations, but changes precisely as or when directed through explicit controls. 



I have had the pleasure of getting valuable industrial experience throughout my Ph.D.: working with Amazon RISC (Regulatory Intelligence, Safety and Compliance) Science team in 2025, Microsoft [Research for industry](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-for-industry/) group in 2024, and [Visa Research](https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/visa-research/mahashweta-das.html) in 2024. Before this, I graduated from IIT Delhi in 2021, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Sayan Ranu](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~sayan/) and mentored by [Prof. Sourav Medya](https://souravmedya.github.io/).
