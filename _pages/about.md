I am a third-year Ph.D. student at Georgia Institute of Technology, being advised by [Prof. Srijan Kumar](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~skumar498/). I have had the pleasure of spending the summers of 2023 at [Visa Research](https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/visa-research/mahashweta-das.html). Before this, I graduated from IIT Delhi in 2021, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Sayan Ranu](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~sayan/).

Through my research, my goal is to study
and build machine learning (ML) models for structured data, which are reliable and can be easily controlled by the users. During my Ph.D. journey so far, I have explored specific research questions within specific areas as listed below and am extremely enthusiastic to continue my exploration in the future.
