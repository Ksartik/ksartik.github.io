I am a third-year Ph.D. student at Georgia Institute of Technology, being advised by [Prof. Srijan Kumar](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~skumar498/). I have had the pleasure of spending the summer of 2023 at [Visa Research](https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/visa-research/mahashweta-das.html). Before this, I graduated from IIT Delhi in 2021, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Sayan Ranu](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~sayan/).

Through my research, my goal is to study and build machine learning (ML) models for structured data, which are reliable and can be easily controlled by the users. To this end, I am focused at measuring the reliability and alignment of existing models (🔎), designing structure-inspired robust (🦺) and user-controllable models (🎛️). During my Ph.D. journey so far, I have explored specific research questions within these areas and am excited to continue my exploration in the future.
