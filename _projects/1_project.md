Using GNNs to efficiently verify LLMs against large knowledge graphs. 

<!-- In an ongoing work, our objective is to efficiently find the alignment between large language
models (LLMs) and large knowledge graphs. LLMs have been shown to suffer from
hallucinations of unnecessary content that can be harmful. Thus, it is extremely important to
pre-emptively identify and flag these failure cases before deployment. Knowledge graphs
provide us with a benchmark to verify the language models at scale. These graphs can be
domain-specific for industry-focused LLMs (such as a set of financial clauses to be followed
by a finance LLM) or general knowledge for general-purpose LLMs (such as Wikipedia for
GPT-3.5). In this work, we aim to find the missing facts in an LLM by asking as few yes/no
queries as possible. To this end, we have designed a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based
architecture to approximate any LLMâ€™s learned knowledge of the facts in a given knowledge
graph based on the previous queries. This allows us to efficiently find missing facts in any
off-the-shelf LLMs even over billion-sized databases by asking a minimal number of queries. -->
